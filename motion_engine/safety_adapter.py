"""Coordinator glue between Safety's command check and MotionStub.

Since PR #65, Safety (`safety_layer/command_check.py`) reads Motion's own
contract `Command` and hands back a Motion `Command`: the original if it is
allowed, otherwise a replacement Motion can execute (HOVER, LAND or
EMERGENCY_LAND, ID `<original id>-safety`, `source = "safety"`). The kind,
target and expiry translation this module used to do is no longer needed.

What is left is one call for the coordinator's dispatch step:

    to_submit, decision = check_for_motion(cmd, assessment, now_ns)
    ack = motion.submit(to_submit, now_ns)
    # log decision.reasons next to the ack

and a guard that refuses to hand Motion anything that is not a Motion
`Command` (for example, if Safety's return type changes again). The tests in
`tests/test_safety_adapter.py` drive the real Safety check and the real
MotionStub together, so a contract drift between the two teams shows up
there first.
